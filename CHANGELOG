v0.99.9-RC4:
*) Added halfmass radii to halo outputs.
*) Fixed bugs in io_arepo.c and sever.c/client.c related to input blocks with no particles (thanks to Alex Ji for catching).
*) Fixed bug wherein setting EXACT_LL_CALC could cause an infinite loop.  (Thanks to Manodeep Sinha for catching).
*) Added experimental capability to dump backtraces on network errors.  (Uncomment BACKTRACE_NETWORK_ERRORS in inet/socket.h to enable).
*) Increased retry attempts for network connection failures.  (Thanks to Julian Onions for finding the problem, as well as contributing the code and solution).
*) Sign error for the Hubble term in kinetic energy calculations now fixed (thanks to Alex Ji for finding).  This has almost no effect on halo catalogs because the Hubble term is extremely subdominant on halo scales.
*) Infinite loop fixed in full particle outputs.  Thanks to Lauren Anderson for finding.
*) Fixes to find parents - thanks to Lyndsay Old for finding.

v0.99.9-RC3 (5/13/14):
*) Fix to io/io_tipsy.c to support non-XDR TIPSY files.  (Thanks to Robert Thompson for finding!).
*) Major fix to shape calculations within R_500c: previous versions were effectively not iterating the shape calculation.
*) Fix to calculation of T/|U|.  Previous versions incorrectly reported 0.5T/|U|.  The Peebles spin calculation is also affected by this error (in calculating |U|).  To correct for this in previous versions, multiply the previous Peebles spin parameter by sqrt(1-T/|U|)/sqrt(2-T/|U|), where T/|U| is the correct value of T/|U| (i.e., twice the value in the T/|U| column).  Thanks to Max Gronke for finding this error.
*) Additional experimental pseudo-evolution mass calculations.
*) Improved simulation data load distribution to reduce network transmissions.
*) Added EXACT_LL_CALC option for more deterministic (but slower) halo property calculation.  Set to 1 to enable.
*) Added HDF5 support for GADGET and AREPO (use FILE_FORMAT=AREPO for both), thanks to Dylan Nelson.
*) Make finish_bgc2 auto-load the box size from BGC2 files (thanks to Manodeep Sinha for catching).
*) Additional field in binary output header to indicate non-compatible binary versions.
*) Experimental binary catalog format for use with future versions of Consistent Trees.


v0.99.9-RC2 (9/27/13):
*) Major fix to shape calculations: previous versions had biased iterative calculations of the shape major axis.  (Thanks to Doug Hellinger for finding!).  Shape calculations are now weighted according to the Allgood et al. approach (1/r^2).
*) Shape calculations are done at two radii (Rvir and R500c by default).  This has resulted in some changes to the output column order.
*) Applied patch from Matt Turk to let YT calculate arbitrary halo properties.
*) Minor changes to ART/GADGET input routines to support loading particles from a pipe instead of a file.
*) Added a STRICT_SO_MASSES mode for calculating SO masses without gravitational unbinding or limits due to the use of FOF for initial group finding.
*) Fixed crashing issues in BGC2/STRICT_SO_MASSES code (thanks to Matt Becker for finding!).
*) Fixed a rare issue wherein BGC/SO masses would be set to the mass of a single particle.
*) Updates to ART code to support new Bolshoi-Planck format.
*) Speed improvements, especially for halos under 10,000 particles.
*) Dark energy equation of state now allowed to be changed (code and testing thanks to Matt Becker).  Change W0 and WA in the config file to use.
*) New script mkpipes.pl to help with making named pipes for use with alternative input formats.
*) README is now a proper manual generated with LaTeX.

v0.99.9 RC1 (3/13/2013):
*) Fixed Rs_Klypin to use bound mass instead of unbound mass for halos when BOUND_PROPS = 1.  (Thanks to Yao-Yuan Mao for finding!).
*) More efficient memory allocation in tree construction.
*) New config parameter (RUN_PARALLEL_ON_SUCCESS) which will launch a program from every analysis process after each snapshot is analyzed.  Rockstar will wait for successful completion before continuing.
*) Fixed segfault in BGC2 output code, as well as a regression that made BGC2 output use twice as much memory as necessary.
*) Added the INITIAL_METRIC_SCALING parameter to adjust the initial weight given to the velocity-space dispersion.  (Relevant for Chris Moody only).

v0.99.8: (Not publicly released)
*) Added FORCE_RES_PHYS_MAX configuration parameter to set the maximum physical force resolution---mainly useful for analyzing simulations at a>>1.

v0.99.7: (Not publicly released)
*) Static code analysis now regular part of release cycle.  (Thanks to both Coverity and to the Clang project).  Two memory leaks (in the TIPSY and BGC2 IO) are now fixed.
*) Fixed crash due to floating-point roundoff errors in building FOF groups across periodic boundaries.
*) Added network profiling.  This will help improve processor utilization in future versions.

v0.99.6: (Not publicly released).
*) Fixed an issue with the lightcone origin being shifted unnecessarily (thanks to Michael Busha for finding!).
*) Code will now automatically increase NUM_WRITERS to FORK_PROCESSORS_PER_MACHINE if the latter is larger.  (Thanks to Marius Cautun for catching).
*) Parallel output to the same file has been shown to cause problems with many filesystems; catalogs are now written in serial again. (Thanks to Michael Busha for finding).
*) Unknown configuration variables are now reported to help catch spelling errors.
*) Updated the merger tree config file script to support scale factors >9.99. (Thanks to Matt Becker for catching!).
*) Improved memory balance over v0.99.5.
*) Corrected TIPSY velocity unit conversion.

v0.99.5: (Not publicly released.)
*) Many new halo parameters calculated: Shape, Central Position/Velocity Offsets, Bullock spin parameter, KE/PE (T/|U|).
*) Updated particle assignment algorithm to use method based on Vmax instead of Mvir.
*) Updated concentration calculation which is now based directly on the mass profile.  The Klypin method for calculating the scale radius is available as a separate column.
*) Updated the Peebles spin parameter calculation to use only the potential from particles within the halo radius.
*) Multiple mass outputs are now available in a single run.  (Defaults are Mvir, M200b, M200c, and M500c).
*) New load-balancing scheme which gets rid of the requirement for overlap regions between processors.  This can substantially reduce memory usage for box sizes < 500 Mpc on a side.
*) Performance improvements in many parts of the code, resulting in a 1.5-2x speedup for many applications.
*) Consistency improvements in temporal tracking code.
*) Improved handling of SIGINTs.
*) Patch from Mike Warren to improve support for running on > 1024 processors (using poll() instead of select()).
*) Special thanks to Mike Warren for contributing many patches and bugfixes during the development of this release.
*) Fixed a bug with halos in major mergers accidentally being assigned some of their host halo's particles.

v0.99.1: (Not publicly released.)
*) Updated velocity calculation to use all particles within 0.1 Rvir.
*) Updated scale factor -> time conversion code to be more accurate as well as work for scale factors > 1.
*) Changed temporal tracking code to track innermost 10% of particles in massive halos, instead of having a fixed maximum at 10k particles.
*) Fixed handling of "\r" in config files.
*) Made Rockstar ignore SIGINTs from MPI.  (Thanks to Matt Turk for the patch).

v0.99 (3/19/2012):
*) Updated the unbinding calculation to use physical velocities instead of peculiar velocities.
*) Improved network layer now supports transparent auto-healing in case of connection failures and better rejection of non-Rockstar connections.
*) No lower boxsize limit for non-periodic boundary conditions.
*) A utility for calculating host-subhalo relationships is now included (see README).
*) Included example source code for reading the particle output formats (see examples/).

v0.98.5 (1/10/2012):
*) Fixed an important issue with calculating Vrms: previously, it was calculated using all particles associated to the halo, instead of just those within the halo radius R_delta (thanks to Michael Busha for catching this).
*) Added support for easy restarting of Rockstar if it terminates in the middle of a run for any reason.  (See restart.cfg in README).
*) Added support for specifying the GADGET halo particle type (if it is not the default, 1).
*) Support for the undocumented "GADGET_INTERNAL" format was removed.
*) Added missing support for auto server port when server address is specified.

v0.98 (12/27/2011):
*) Increased the speed of boundary checks; the particle distribution stage is now more efficient.
*) Fixed an issue whereby duplicate halos could be output in merger trees; this only appears on certain versions of Linux when there are very few halos per processor (thanks to Markus Haider for finding this!).
*) Fixed two issues where calculating the position and velocity variance of particle groups would in hang in rare instances (Thanks to Michael Busha for finding the first of these!).
*) Fixed a mistake in the IO code which prevented TIPSY support from working (Thanks to Michael Busha for catching this!).
*) Updated the readme to be clearer about how to run Rockstar in master/client mode.
