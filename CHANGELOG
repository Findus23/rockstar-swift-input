v0.99.9 RC1 (3/13/2013):
*) Fixed Rs_Klypin to use bound mass instead of unbound mass for halos when BOUND_PROPS = 1.  (Thanks to Yao-Yuan Mao for finding!).
*) More efficient memory allocation in tree construction.
*) New config parameter (RUN_PARALLEL_ON_SUCCESS) which will launch a program from every analysis process after each snapshot is analyzed.  Rockstar will wait for successful completion before continuing.
*) Fixed segfault in BGC2 output code, as well as a regression that made BGC2 output use twice as much memory as necessary.
*) Added the INITIAL_METRIC_SCALING parameter to adjust the initial weight given to the velocity-space dispersion.  (Relevant for Chris Moody only).

v0.99.8: (Not publicly released)
*) Added FORCE_RES_PHYS_MAX configuration parameter to set the maximum physical force resolution---mainly useful for analyzing simulations at a>>1.

v0.99.7: (Not publicly released)
*) Static code analysis now regular part of release cycle.  (Thanks to both Coverity and to the Clang project).  Two memory leaks (in the TIPSY and BGC2 IO) are now fixed. 
*) Fixed crash due to floating-point roundoff errors in building FOF groups across periodic boundaries.
*) Added network profiling.  This will help improve processor utilization in future versions.

v0.99.6: (Not publicly released).
*) Fixed an issue with the lightcone origin being shifted unnecessarily (thanks to Michael Busha for finding!).
*) Code will now automatically increase NUM_WRITERS to FORK_PROCESSORS_PER_MACHINE if the latter is larger.  (Thanks to Marius Cautun for catching).
*) Parallel output to the same file has been shown to cause problems with many filesystems; catalogs are now written in serial again. (Thanks to Michael Busha for finding).
*) Unknown configuration variables are now reported to help catch spelling errors.
*) Updated the merger tree config file script to support scale factors >9.99. (Thanks to Matt Becker for catching!).
*) Improved memory balance over v0.99.5.
*) Corrected TIPSY velocity unit conversion.

v0.99.5: (Not publicly released.)
*) Many new halo parameters calculated: Shape, Central Position/Velocity Offsets, Bullock spin parameter, KE/PE (T/|U|).
*) Updated particle assignment algorithm to use method based on Vmax instead of Mvir.
*) Updated concentration calculation which is now based directly on the mass profile.  The Klypin method for calculating the scale radius is available as a separate column.
*) Updated the Peebles spin parameter calculation to use only the potential from particles within the halo radius.
*) Multiple mass outputs are now available in a single run.  (Defaults are Mvir, M200b, M200c, and M500c).
*) New load-balancing scheme which gets rid of the requirement for overlap regions between processors.  This can substantially reduce memory usage for box sizes < 500 Mpc on a side.
*) Performance improvements in many parts of the code, resulting in a 1.5-2x speedup for many applications.
*) Consistency improvements in temporal tracking code.
*) Improved handling of SIGINTs.
*) Patch from Mike Warren to improve support for running on > 1024 processors (using poll() instead of select()).
*) Special thanks to Mike Warren for contributing many patches and bugfixes during the development of this release.
*) Fixed a bug with halos in major mergers accidentally being assigned some of their host halo's particles.

v0.99.1: (Not publicly released.)
*) Updated velocity calculation to use all particles within 0.1 Rvir.
*) Updated scale factor -> time conversion code to be more accurate as well as work for scale factors > 1.
*) Changed temporal tracking code to track innermost 10% of particles in massive halos, instead of having a fixed maximum at 10k particles.
*) Fixed handling of "\r" in config files.
*) Made Rockstar ignore SIGINTs from MPI.  (Thanks to Matt Turk for the patch).

v0.99 (3/19/2012):
*) Updated the unbinding calculation to use physical velocities instead of peculiar velocities.
*) Improved network layer now supports transparent auto-healing in case of connection failures and better rejection of non-Rockstar connections.
*) No lower boxsize limit for non-periodic boundary conditions.
*) A utility for calculating host-subhalo relationships is now included (see README).
*) Included example source code for reading the particle output formats (see examples/).

v0.98.5 (1/10/2012):
*) Fixed an important issue with calculating Vrms: previously, it was calculated using all particles associated to the halo, instead of just those within the halo radius R_delta (thanks to Michael Busha for catching this).
*) Added support for easy restarting of Rockstar if it terminates in the middle of a run for any reason.  (See restart.cfg in README).
*) Added support for specifying the GADGET halo particle type (if it is not the default, 1).
*) Support for the undocumented "GADGET_INTERNAL" format was removed.
*) Added missing support for auto server port when server address is specified.

v0.98 (12/27/2011):
*) Increased the speed of boundary checks; the particle distribution stage is now more efficient.
*) Fixed an issue whereby duplicate halos could be output in merger trees; this only appears on certain versions of Linux when there are very few halos per processor (thanks to Markus Haider for finding this!).
*) Fixed two issues where calculating the position and velocity variance of particle groups would in hang in rare instances (Thanks to Michael Busha for finding the first of these!).
*) Fixed a mistake in the IO code which prevented TIPSY support from working (Thanks to Michael Busha for catching this!).
*) Updated the readme to be clearer about how to run Rockstar in master/client mode.

v0.97.1:
*) Added support for user-configurable load-balancing.

v0.97 (11/1/2011):
*) Fixed a race condition which was halting execution for snapshots without any halos.
*) Included config files to run on the Ranger machine at TACC.
*) Added YT support (from Matt Turk).
*) Added initial/alpha support for reading TIPSY files (from Greg Stinson).

v0.96.2 (10/20/2011):
Initial public release
