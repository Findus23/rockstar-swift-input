1) Compiling:
   If you use the GNU C compiler version 4.0 or above on a 64-bit machine,
   compiling should be as simple as typing "make" at the command prompt.

   Rockstar does not support compiling on 32-bit machines and has not been
   tested with other compilers.  Additionally, Rockstar does not support
   non-Unix environments.  (Mac OS X is fine; Windows is not).

2) Running
   i) Quick start (single snapshot):
      Several example configuration files have been provided.  If you have a
      small simulation file and you'd like to run Rockstar on a single processor
      to test its output, edit the file "quickstart.cfg" and change the file
      format to one of "ASCII", "GADGET", "ART", or "TIPSY" to match your
      simulation file.  If you use the ART option, only PMss files are
      currently supported.  (PMcrs files, which do not include particle IDs
      explicitly, are not supported).

      If you use "ASCII", "ART", or "TIPSY", you will additionally have to set
      the particle mass; if you use "ASCII" or "TIPSY", you will also have to
      set parameters for the cosmology and box size.

      If you use GADGET, you should check to make sure that the length
      and mass conversion multipliers are correct (GADGET_LENGTH_CONVERSION and
      GADGET_MASS_CONVERSION) to convert Gadget internal units to comoving Mpc/h
      and Msun/h.

      Similarly, if you use TIPSY, you should set the length and velocity
      conversion multipliers (TIPSY_LENGTH_CONVERSION and TIPSY_MASS_CONVERSION)
      to convert Tipsy internal units to comoving Mpc/h and physical km/s.
      *Note that TIPSY format is in an alpha stage of support---please contact
       me if you have issues!*

      Then, you can run Rockstar: "./rockstar -c quickstart.cfg <particle file>"
      
      Note that periodic boundary conditions are *not* assumed for a single-cpu
      run.  (For that, see the section on parallel IO).

   ii) More complete setup (multiple snapshots/input files):
      Note: Rockstar does *not* use MPI for its parallelization.  As such,
      there should be no headaches with finding a working MPI installation
      to use. :)

      For running on multiple snapshots or simulations with multiple input
      files per snapshot, Rockstar uses a master process to direct the
      order of processing steps and several client processes to do the
      actual work.

      For historical reasons, enabling Rockstar to run on multiple input files
      or multiple snapshots is controlled by setting the following "Parallel
      IO" option in the config file:

      	 PARALLEL_IO = 1

      Several more options are necessary in the configuration file to specify
      filenames, paths, and information about the number of processes you want
      to use.

      By default, the number of reading tasks is set to the number
      of files being read for each simulation snapshot:

         NUM_BLOCKS = <number of files per snapshot>

      However, if you want to have a different (smaller) number of reading
      tasks, you have to use:

      	 NUM_READERS = <number of reading tasks>

      (This is helpful if the number of files per snapshot exceeds the maximum
      number of connections allowed by the system on a single socket.)

      You will also have to provide information on where the data files are
      located.  To do so, you will have to set:

      	 INBASE = "/directory/where/files/are/located"
         FILENAME = "my_sim.<snap>.<block>"

      In this example, "my_sim" should be the base of your simulation filename.
      For multiple snapshots, the text "<snap>" will be automatically replaced
      by the snapshot number, and the text "<block>" will be automatically
      replaced by the block number (0 to NUM_BLOCKS-1).  To specify the range
      of snapshot numbers, you may set

         NUM_SNAPS = <total number of snapshots>
	 STARTING_SNAP = <first snap> #defaults to 0
  
      If you have nonstandard names for your snapshots (e.g., "001" instead of
      "1"), you may create a text file with one snapshot name per line and set:

         SNAPSHOT_NAMES = </path/to/snapshot names>

      This will automatically override the number of snapshots and the starting
      snapshot if specified.  You may do the same thing for the block names,
      too:

         BLOCK_NAMES = </path/to/block names>

      (Note that NUM_BLOCKS should still be specified in this case, so that the
      server knows how many reader connections to accept).

      The number of analysis tasks can be set to either 1 or a multiple of
      8.  If set to 1, periodic boundary conditions are *not* assumed; otherwise
      periodic boundary conditions *are* assumed (see also the "PERIODIC" option
      in the full list of config options).  To set the number of analysis
      tasks, set:

      	  NUM_WRITERS = <number of analysis tasks>

      Starting Rockstar (under the default options) is then accomplished by
      first starting the server process: /path/to/rockstar -c server.cfg
      The server process will generate a file called "auto-rockstar.cfg" in the
      data output directory (OUTBASE, see below) with contact information;
      you should then start client processes on all the machine(s) necessary
      (/path/to/rockstar -c OUTBASE/auto-rockstar.cfg).

      Specifically, you will have to start NUM_READERS (usually, NUM_BLOCKS)
      reader tasks and NUM_WRITERS writer tasks.  To simplify this process,
      there are two additional options you can set:

         FORK_READERS_FROM_WRITERS = 1
	 FORK_PROCESSORS_PER_MACHINE = <number of processors per machine>

      The first option will automatically split off the reader tasks for you
      (which are idle most of the time) so that you only have to start the
      analysis tasks.  The second option will automatically split each analysis
      task into many separate tasks (according to the number of processors
      you specify to use per machine).  Thus, if set, you would only have to
      start Rockstar running once on each machine (instead of once per
      processor).  The command to start Rockstar for the reading/analysis tasks
      is (as explained above): /path/to/rockstar -c OUTBASE/auto-rockstar.cfg

      In terms of memory usage, Rockstar will use about 60 bytes / particle
      *maximum total* for a cosmological simulation.  Thus, if you have a
      1024^3 simulation and 2G of memory available per processor, you should
      plan on using at least 32 processors in parallel.  Note that this
      includes the particle readers as well---readers delete particles from
      memory as soon as they are sent to the analysis tasks so that no extra
      memory is wasted.

      If Rockstar is terminated for any reason, it is easy to restart it where
      it left off.  Simply start the server process by running:
      /path/to/rockstar -c OUTBASE/restart.cfg .  Then, start client processes
      as you would normally (either from auto-rockstar.cfg or your usual
      config file).  Rockstar will automatically start from the last snapshot
      which was incomplete.

   iii) Merger trees
      By default, the output files for Rockstar include some basic descendant
      information for each halo.  However, it is strongly recommended that
      you use a more sophisticated package, such as Consistent Trees
      ( http://code.google.com/p/consistent-trees ) to improve consistency
      between timesteps before using the descendant information for science
      purposes (e.g., calculating merger rates).  Rockstar includes a script
      to autogenerate configuration files for Consistent Trees (see the
      Consistent Trees README file for use).

   iv) Host / Subhalo relationships
      By default, the output files for Rockstar do not include information
      about which halos are hosts (as opposed to subhalos).  This is because
      the consistent tree code (see Merger trees, above) automatically
      calculates such relationships.  However, if you do not intend to use the
      merger tree code, then there is a utility included with Rockstar to
      postprocess the output halo catalogs (i.e., the out_*.list files).  To
      compile, run "make parents" from the Rockstar source directory.  Then,
      run the following command

      	  /path/to/rockstar/util/find_parents <box_size> out_XYZ.list

      on each halo catalog for which you want to find host halos.  Information
      about which halos are hosts and which are subs will be output as an
      extra column, the parent ID.  Host halos will have a parent ID of -1;
      subhaloes will have a parent ID which corresponds to their host halo ID.

   v) Lightcone setup
      Lightcones are currently only supported with parallel IO (see options
      above).  To turn on lightcone support, set

         LIGHTCONE = 1

      The scale factor will be automatically computed (flat cosmologies only)
      from the distance to the origin, which is set by

         LIGHTCONE_ORIGIN = (x,y,z) # default: (0,0,0)

      If you want a lightcone created by joining two different fields of view
      from the same box, you will have to set the following options:

         LIGHTCONE_ALT_SNAPS = /path/to/second_lightcone_snapnames
	 LIGHTCONE_ALT_ORIGIN = (x,y,z) #default: (0,0,0)

      (The LIGHTCONE_ALT_ORIGIN option translates all particles in the second
      field of view from (x,y,z) to the first LIGHTCONE_ORIGIN.)  If using two
      fields of view, it is assumed that they have equal numbers of input files;
      NUM_BLOCKS should be set to the combined total number of input files.

      If you have more than two fields of view from the same box, you will
      have to make sure that their positions are already translated
      appropriately so that they can be joined/unioned together without any
      overlap issues.  In this case, you should not set any of the ALT lightcone
      options.  Additionally, you should set IGNORE_PARTICLE_IDS = 1 so as
      to prevent confusion with the same particle ID appearing multiple times.

   vi) Controlling Output Formats:
      Rockstar can currently output in either ascii or binary formats.
      You can control the output directory for halo catalogs by setting:

         OUTBASE = "/desired/output/path" # default is current directory

      By default, both binary and ascii catalogs are printed.  You can change
      this by setting:

         OUTPUT_FORMAT = "BOTH" # or "ASCII" or "BINARY"

      However, as the binary outputs are required for generating merger trees,
      merger trees will *not* be generated if you select the "ASCII" option.
      If you want merger trees but not the binary outputs (which take up
      lots of space), you can set the following option:

         DELETE_BINARY_OUTPUT_AFTER_FINISHED = 1

      For the binary outputs, there is a 256-byte header (detailed in
      io/meta_io.h) followed by a binary dump of the halo structures
      (see halo.h), followed by a binary dump of the particle ids in
      each halo (type int64_t).  See the load_binary_halos() routine in
      io/meta_io.c for an example of how to read in the binary files.

      To change the minimum particle size of output halos, set

          MIN_HALO_OUTPUT_SIZE = <minimum number of particles> #default: 20

      Note that this option does *not* specify the minimum number of particles
      bound within the virial or other halo radius.  Instead, it specifies the
      minimum number of particles which Rockstar identifies as uniquely assigned
      to that halo.  The virial mass can (and usually will) be much less.

      To avoid printing spurious halos, Rockstar excludes significantly 
      unbound objects by default.  To change the threshold of what is considered
      "significantly unbound"---e.g., for studying tidal remnants, you may
      consider lowering the value of the following parameter:      

      	 UNBOUND_THRESHOLD = <minimum fraction of bound mass> #default: 0.5

      Generally, this affects the halo mass function at the few percent level
      for halos of 100 bound particles or less.

      Rockstar does not by default output full particle information to
      save space.  In order to turn on this capability, set

         FULL_PARTICLE_CHUNKS = <number of processes to output particles>

      to the desired number of analysis processes which you want to output
      particles (i.e., something between 1 and NUM_WRITERS) at every timestep.

      Alternately, you can choose to use the BGC2 output format, which
      records full particle information as well as some halo information for
      an entire snapshot.  In order to turn on this capability, set

         BGC2_SNAPNAMES = </path/to/snapshot_names>

      Where the file contains a list of snapshots (formatted the same way as
      in SNAPSHOT_NAMES, if you used that option) for which you want BGC2
      output.  (Note that BGC2 output is the only way to obtain a fully SO
      mass calculation, as all other mass calculations are performed on
      FOF groups, which may not include all the particles out to the desired
      mass threshold.)  Note that the BGC2 format is currently incompatible
      with processing lightcones.

      Once the BGC2 files have been generated, a short postprocessing step
      is necessary to bring them into full compliance with the spec (calculating
      subs/centrals, etc.).  You will need to compile the postprocessing
      code with:

         make bgc2

      Then, for every BGC2 snapshot you have generated, you will need to run

         /path/to/rockstar/util/finish_bgc2 -c rockstar.cfg -s <snap>

      Note that particles in BGC2 files are automatically wrapped around
      box edges if periodic boundary conditions are enabled; this way, they
      always form contiguous regions.

   vii) Infiniband / Network Connectivity Notes:
      As particle transfer is usually a small fraction of the total analysis
      time, Rockstar performs well on pretty much any gigabit or faster network.

      However, if you have IP over Infiniband, Rockstar can use this natively;
      for the server address, you simply have to specify the IP address
      assigned to the Infiniband port.  Alternately, if you have "auto"
      specified for the server name, you may force Rockstar to use the
      Infiniband interface (e.g., "ib0") with the following config option:

         PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_INTERFACE = "ib0"

      Rockstar supports IPv4 and IPv6 natively; addresses may be specified
      in either format.

   viii) Full Configuration Options:
      For those options not mentioned directly above:

      	  MASS_DEFINITION = <"vir" or "XXXc" or "XXXb" etc.> #default: vir

      This lets you specify how you want masses calculated.  "vir" uses the
      formula from Bryan & Norman 1998; a number plus "c" or "b" calculates
      masses relative to the critical or background density, respectively.
      (E.g. "200b" or "200c", or even "1600b").

          SCALE_NOW = <current cosmological scale factor>
	  h0 = <hubble constant today> # in units of 100 km/s/Mpc
	  Ol = <Omega_Lambda> # in units of the critical density
	  Om = <Omega_Matter> # in units of the critical density

      These cosmology options are only relevant if one is reading from an ASCII
      or TIPSY particle file.  (For TIPSY, the SCALE_NOW parameter may be
      omitted).  For other data formats, these values are automatically
      overwritten with values in the particle data files.

          PARTICLE_MASS = <mass of each particle> #in Msun/h

      It is not necessary to specify the particle mass for GADGET2 files.
      However, for GADGET2 files, you will need to specify the conversion to
      Rockstar's internal length (comoving Mpc/h) and mass (Msun/h) units:

          GADGET_MASS_CONVERSION = <conversion from GADGET units to Msun/h>
	  GADGET_LENGTH_CONVERSION = <conversion from GADGET units to Mpc/h>

      In general, these will be ~1e10 (mass conversion) and either 1 or
      1e-3 (length conversion for Mpc/h and kpc/h, respectively).

      Similarly, for TIPSY files, you will need to convert lengths and
      velocities to comoving MPC/h and physical km/s:

	  TIPSY_LENGTH_CONVERSION = <conversion from TIPSY units to Mpc/h>
          TIPSY_VELOCITY_CONVERSION = <conversion from TIPSY units to km/s>

      *Note that TIPSY format is in an alpha stage of support---please contact
       me if you have issues!*

      To disable periodic boundary conditions (only applicable for PARALLEL_IO),
      you can set:
      
          PERIODIC = 0

      *Note that setting this to 1 does not enable periodic boundary conditions
      for single-processor halo finding.*

      	  BOX_SIZE = <side length of cosmological box in comoving Mpc/h>

      The box size is only necessary to set for ASCII particle data.

      	  GADGET_SKIP_NON_HALO_PARTICLES = <0 or 1> #default = 1

      By default, Rockstar only considers dark matter particles; the preceeding
      option can be set to 0 to force consideration of other particles as well
      in GADGET2 files.  The default halo particle type in GADGET is 1; however,
      if you need to change this, you can use the following option:

          GADGET_HALO_PARTICLE_TYPE = <0 to 5> #default = 1

      Note that Rockstar has no current support for multiple particle masses.

      	  RESCALE_PARTICLE_MASSES = <0 or 1> #default 1

      If only dark matter particles are used from GADGET2 files in a simulation
      which also includes gas particles, it is necessary to rescale the particle
      masses so as to preserve the correct matter density; setting this option
      tells Rockstar to do so.

      If for some reason your simulation data has inconsistent or duplicate
      particle IDs, you can set the following option to prevent problems with
      halo finding:

          IGNORE_PARTICLE_IDS = 1

      Note that in this case, merger trees are disabled.

      As mentioned above, Rockstar requires one master server accessible by
      all reading/analyis tasks.  The server does not require access to any
      data files, but it must be of the same architecture as the reading/
      analysis tasks.  In order to contact the master server, the reading/
      analysis tasks need to know its address, specified by the following two
      options in the config file:

      	 PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_ADDRESS = <server address> #default: auto
	 PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_PORT = <server port> #default: auto

      The server port should be in the range 1025-65000, and it should be
      unblocked by the server firewall.  Alternately, you may specify
      "auto" for both the server address and the server port.  In this case,
      once you launch the server process, it will write to a file called
      "auto-rockstar.cfg" in the launch directory (or the directory that
      OUTBASE is set to).  This file will contain updated settings with
      the machine name and port for the server, which you can then use
      to launch the reading/analysis tasks.  To force Rockstar to use a
      specified interface (useful for machines on multiple networks),
      you can use:

      	 PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_INTERFACE = <interface name> # ib0, for example

      Since analysis tasks have to acquire particle data from reading tasks,
      the analysis tasks need to be contactable by the reading tasks.  You
      should choose a port number for the analysis tasks which is distinct
      from the server port above:

          PARALLEL_IO_WRITER_PORT = <port from 1025-65000>

      If you have a firewall, you will have to open this port for access
      *as well as* the N ports above this port, where N is the number of
      analysis tasks you are running per machine.

      The following options determine details of the halo finding.  To tell
      Rockstar to calculate halo radii as well as Vmax, Rvmax, and other
      halo properties from the *unbound* particles, set the following option
      to 0:

          BOUND_PROPS = <0 or 1> #default 1

      To change the default FOF refinement fraction (see the Rockstar paper),
      change:

          FOF_FRACTION = <FOF refinement fraction> #default 0.7

      To change the default 3D FOF linking length, set:

          FOF_LINKING_LENGTH = <FOF linking length> #default 0.28

      To set the force resolution (or equivalently, the softening length),
      set:

          FORCE_RES = <force resolution> #default: 0.0012, in comoving Mpc/h

      To change the minimum (internal) number of particles considered to be
      a halo seed, change:

          MIN_HALO_PARTICLES = <minimum number of halo particles> #default: 10

      See also MIN_HALO_OUTPUT_SIZE, above.

      To run postprocessing scripts after each snapshot finishes, you can use
      the RUN_ON_SUCCESS config option:

      	  RUN_ON_SUCCESS = "/path/to/myscript"

      The script will be executed with two arguments: the snapshot number
      followed by the snapshot name (only different if specified via the
      SNAPSHOT_NAMES file).

      To specify your own load-balancing distribution, you can use the
      LOAD_BALANCE_SCRIPT option.  There is an example of such a script in
      the scripts directory; to use, set the LOAD_BALANCE_SCRIPT option to
      "perl /path/to/rockstar/scripts/sample_loadbalance.pl".  The script is
      given the number of writer tasks, the recommended dimensional divisions,
      the box size, the scale factor, as well as the IP addresses and ports
      of all the writer tasks.  The script is expected to reoutput the
      information for each writer task along with an additional set of six
      numbers specifying the boundary region (min_x, min_y, min_z) to
      (max_x, max_y, max_z).  The boundary region *must* be contained within
      the box size in each dimension; the boundary regions are also assumed to
      be overlapping (it is up to your script to check this).
